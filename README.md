### I - Communication protocols

	What is communication protocols ?
	â‡’ A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communication system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.

	The protocol defines the rules , the syntax , the synchronization , semantics , communication and possible error recovery methods. 

	For anologie communication protocole is like programming language for computation
	or for another analogy communication protocol is like algorithms for computation 

	Multipl protocols often describe differents aspects of a single communication.

	Internet protocols are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

	Some of best protocols-suite : 
	TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, X.25, AX.25 and AppleTalk

### A / Types of protocols

	We are two type of protocols : 
	Text Based Protocols and Binary Protocol
	
	| Text Based Protcol | 
	It's a protocol more readable for humain.
	the text based representation trensmits request and response as line of ASCII text. 
	We can find : FTP (File Transfert Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfert Protocol), the Finger Protocol

	| Binary protocol |
	A binary protocol utilizes all values of a byte.
	Binary protocols are intended to read a machine rather than a human.
	Binary protocol have been use in the normative documents describing modern standards like HTTP/2, HTTP/3 ,EbXML, EDOC and an interface in UML
