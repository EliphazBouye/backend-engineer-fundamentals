	â‡’ A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communication system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.

	The protocol defines the rules , the syntax , the synchronization , semantics , communication and possible error recovery methods. 

	For anologie communication protocole is like programming language for computation
	or for another analogy communication protocol is like algorithms for computation 

	Multipl protocols often describe differents aspects of a single communication.

	Internet protocols are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
